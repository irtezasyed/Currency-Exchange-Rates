# Currency-Exchange-Rates

Gathered daily data of exchange rates from the year 1995 to 2019, and performed time series analysis.
Applied basic forecasting techniques (mean, naive, seasonal naive and drift) to advanced such as Holt, Holt Winter, Autoregressive, and Arima etc.
Based on the overall performance of models, the ARIMA(4,1,1) turned out to be the best model.
Used R Shiny web framework to create an interactive web UI to display predicted distributions.
